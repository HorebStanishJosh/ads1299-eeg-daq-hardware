# ADS1299 EEG Data Acquisition Hardware

## Overview

This repository contains the **hardware design documentation** for an **ADS1299-based EEG data acquisition system**, developed with a focus on **low-noise analog front-end design**, signal integrity, and **manufacturable PCB layout**.

The project targets multi-channel biopotential signal acquisition and is intended for research, prototyping, and hardware development purposes.

> **Note:** Native design files and firmware sources are not provided. Documentation is shared in non-editable formats only.
